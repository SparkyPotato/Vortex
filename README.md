# Vortex
Vortex aims to be a high-performance, cross-platform Game Engine and Application Framework.  

## Getting Started with Vortex

Head over to the Wiki, where pages will pop-up when Vortex is in a state where there's actually something to see or do with the Engine.

## Goals

1. To create a cross-platform Game Engine, which also functions as an Application Framework. Vortex aims to support all three major desktop platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2. Native Render API support - DirectX for Windows, Metal for Mac, and Vulkan for Linux.

3. Ability to create interactive, immersive 3D worlds, with Physically Based Rendering.

4. High-fidelity audio system.

5. Physics simulations, without using any 3rd party engines.

## Current status

Vortex is currently in very early stages of development, without a functional renderer or any game-systems.
